# Project Euler - Byte This
This repo contains all of the problems which I've solved so far and the utilities I've created to solve them. **This is a work in progress**

## Project Goals
I will be solving the first 100 problems and for each problem:
* Create a YouTube video where I discuss implementation strategy and code the solution.
* Store the code in this repo, as well as any notes and additional metadata, to be consumed by www.bytethisstore.com .

When the work is concluded, users will be able to view all of my solutions to these problems in video or webpage formats. The webpages, 1 for each problem, will include the video as an embedded object and will also include the relevant code in this repo pertaining to that problems.

## Future Steps
1. Finish solving all 100 problems.
2. Finish editing and publishing all 100 videos.
3. Create the integration so www.bytethisstore.com can enumerate one individual page for each problem. The website will integrate with Git and possibly YouTube to accomplish this.
4. Enhance the integration to display metrics, including execution time required for each solution. From there, determine which problems should be revisited to be further optimized.
