# Project Euler - Byte This
This repo contains our solutions to the first 100 Project Euler problems and the utilities we've created to solve them.

## Additional Resources
We've compiled some resources to assist in working through these Project Euler problems.
* **Full Catalog of Problems:** Our [Website Catalog](https://bytethisstore.com/articles/pg/project-euler) houses our solutions. Each page on the catalog will include the problem's problem statement, our video walkthrough, and our code. All relevant code files for that problem, including utilities, are assembled into one place.
* **Video Walkthroughs:** Our [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUwVCIwecKmXvQQRE5F2E9KAl-bQ-bKYF) includes videos for all 100 problems. Each video will read the problem statement, analyse what the problem is asking for and how to implement a solution, and make & run the code for that solution.
